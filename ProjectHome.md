## J-ARP:Light-weight ARP Spoofing Protection Software ##

ARP Spoof (or ARP cache poisoning) is an intimidating problem for LAN security. It can be used for Denial of Service (DoS) or Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks. So far, there have been several solutions, proposed to solve this serious problem. However, most of them have some serious drawbacks such as infeasibility, unmanageability, expensively and ineffectiveness. So, in this project, we have proposed a new solution, which is feasible, manageable, inexpensive and effective. The solution is named “J-ARP” and is required only to install at the user station without needed any software at router.
